I'm half Turkish, half New Zealander. I studied Computer Science in the UK and then found myself in the tech industry back in Istanbul.

I've held roles as product manager since 2012 at a variety of companies in ecommerce, online dating, marketplaces, SaaS, and most recently mobile gaming. For further details regarding my experiences feel free to get in contact with me!
